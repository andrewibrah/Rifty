# Python AI Service (FastAPI)

Placeholder FastAPI service for moving AI orchestration off the mobile app.

## Next steps
- Add domain routers for chat, memory, embeddings, and summarization.
- Consume shared DTOs (generate pydantic models or use `pydantic` schemas derived from `packages/shared`).
- Wire auth between Supabase and this service, and document deployment targets.
- Add tests plus a lightweight container image for local development.
