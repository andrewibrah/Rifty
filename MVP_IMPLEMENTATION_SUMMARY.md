# Riflett MVP Implementation Summary

## Overview

The MVP structure has been fully integrated into your existing Riflett codebase as **additive enhancements**. Nothing was recreated or broken—all new features layer on top of your current working application.

---

## What Was Built

### 1. Database Layer (Supabase)

**New Tables:**
- `entry_summaries` - AI-generated summaries with emotion, topics, people, urgency, suggested actions
- `entry_embeddings` - OpenAI embeddings (1536-dimensional vectors) for semantic search
- `user_facts` - Persistent memory: learned patterns ("mornings are best for deep work")
- `goals` - Structured goals with micro-steps, status tracking, and source entry links
- `check_ins` - Daily morning/evening + weekly prompts with responses

**New Functions:**
- `match_entry_embeddings()` - Cosine similarity search using pgvector

**File:** `supabase/migrations/20250114000000_mvp_enhancements.sql`

---

### 2. TypeScript Types

**New Types:**
- `EntrySummary`, `CreateEntrySummaryParams`
- `EntryEmbedding`, `SimilarEntry`
- `UserFact`, `CreateUserFactParams`
- `Goal`, `MicroStep`, `GoalStatus`, `CreateGoalParams`
- `CheckIn`, `CheckInType`, `CreateCheckInParams`
- `SummarizeEntryResult`, `AnalystQueryResult`, `GoalDetectionResult`

**File:** `src/types/mvp.ts`

---

### 3. Service Layer

**5 New Services:**

1. **`src/services/embeddings.ts`**
   - `generateEmbedding(text)` - Generate OpenAI embedding
   - `embedEntry(entryId, content)` - Store embedding for entry
   - `findSimilarEntries(query, options)` - Semantic search
   - `getEntryEmbedding(entryId)` - Retrieve embedding

2. **`src/services/summarization.ts`**
   - `summarizeEntry(content, type)` - 2-3 line summary + emotion/topics/action/reflection
   - `detectGoal(content)` - Detect if entry implies a goal
   - `storeEntrySummary(params)` - Save summary to DB
   - `getEntrySummary(entryId)` - Retrieve summary
   - `listEntrySummaries(options)` - Get all summaries

3. **`src/services/memory.ts`**
   - `buildRAGContext(query)` - Fetch relevant entries + facts for context
   - `answerAnalystQuery(query)` - Answer questions with citations
   - `createUserFact(params)` - Store learned fact
   - `listUserFacts(options)` - Retrieve facts
   - `updateUserFact(id, updates)` - Update/confirm fact
   - `deleteUserFact(id)` - Remove fact

4. **`src/services/goals.ts`**
   - `createGoal(params)` - Create new goal
   - `getGoalById(id)` - Get goal details
   - `listGoals(options)` - Get all goals (filterable by status)
   - `updateGoal(id, updates)` - Update goal
   - `completeMicroStep(goalId, stepId)` - Mark step done
   - `addMicroStep(goalId, description)` - Add new step
   - `deleteGoal(id)` - Delete goal
   - `getActiveGoals()` - Get active goals for UI

5. **`src/services/checkIns.ts`**
   - `createCheckIn(params)` - Create scheduled check-in
   - `getPendingCheckIn(type?)` - Get today's pending check-in
   - `completeCheckIn(id, params)` - Mark check-in done
   - `scheduleDailyCheckIns(timezone)` - Schedule morning + evening
   - `scheduleWeeklyCheckIn(timezone)` - Schedule Sunday review
   - `listCheckIns(options)` - Get all check-ins

---

### 4. Edge Function

**`supabase/functions/process_entry_mvp/index.ts`**

Complete Write → Reflect → Act pipeline:
1. Classify intent (journal/goal/schedule)
2. Create entry
3. Summarize (2-3 lines, emotion, topics, urgency, action, reflection)
4. Generate embedding (text-embedding-3-small)
5. Detect goal (if applicable)
6. Return reflection + metadata

All steps after entry creation are **non-blocking** and gracefully degrade on error.

---

### 5. Client Integration

**Enhanced Entry Creation:**
- `src/lib/entries.ts` - Added `createEntryMVP()` function
- Returns `ProcessedEntryResult` with entry, summary, embedding status, goal detection, and reflection

**New Chat Hook:**
- `src/hooks/useChatStateMVP.ts` - Drop-in replacement for `useChatState`
- Detects analyst queries vs entries
- Handles both creation and question-answering
- Tracks `pendingAction` and `pendingGoal` for UI prompts

**Check-In Hook:**
- `src/hooks/useCheckIns.ts`
- Auto-loads pending check-ins
- Polls every 15 minutes
- Handles completion and scheduling

---

### 6. UI Components

**3 New Components:**

1. **`src/components/ActionPrompt.tsx`**
   - Displays suggested next action
   - Actions: Accept, Edit, Ignore

2. **`src/components/GoalPrompt.tsx`**
   - Shows detected goal with title, description, micro-steps
   - Actions: Create Goal, Not Now

3. **`src/components/CheckInBanner.tsx`**
   - Morning/evening/weekly prompt
   - Type-specific emoji and label
   - Actions: Respond, Dismiss

All components use existing theme system and styling.

---

## How the Flow Works

### Entry Creation (Write → Reflect → Act)

1. User types: "Had a tough day at work, feeling stressed"
2. Client calls `createEntryMVP(content)`
3. Edge function:
   - Classifies as "journal"
   - Saves entry to DB
   - Summarizes: "User had a difficult workday and is feeling stressed"
   - Extracts: emotion="stressed", topics=["work"], urgency=6
   - Suggests: "Take 10 minutes to decompress before evening activities"
   - Generates embedding
   - Returns reflection: "It sounds like today was challenging. Remember, difficult days are temporary."
4. Client displays:
   - Entry with badge (journal)
   - Bot message with reflection
   - Action prompt (if action was suggested)

### Analyst Query

1. User types: "What patterns from this week?"
2. Client detects question pattern
3. Calls `answerAnalystQuery(query)`
4. Service:
   - Generates query embedding
   - Finds top 5 similar entries (cosine similarity)
   - Fetches summaries and user facts
   - Builds context
   - Sends to OpenAI with citations
5. Returns: "This week you've mentioned work stress 4 times (see 10/12, 10/14 notes). You also completed 2 workouts (10/11, 10/13). Consider scheduling more breaks."

### Goal Detection

1. User types: "I want to run 3x per week"
2. Edge function detects goal intent
3. Creates goal record:
   - Title: "Run 3x per week"
   - Category: "health"
   - Micro-steps: ["Buy running shoes", "Map out routes", "Set Monday alarm"]
4. Client shows GoalPrompt
5. User accepts → Goal is active

### Daily Check-In

1. At 8 AM, check-in becomes "pending"
2. useCheckIns hook detects it
3. CheckInBanner appears: "One priority, one constraint?"
4. User taps "Respond"
5. Input pre-fills with prompt
6. User types response
7. Response is saved as entry + check-in is marked complete
8. Next check-in is scheduled

## What's NOT Included (Per MVP Scope)

- No multi-agent orchestration
- No custom models or fine-tuning
- No fancy dashboards

- No calendar sync
- No push notifications (check-ins are polling-based)

---

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy**: Run migrations and deploy edge function
2. **Integrate**: Update `App.tsx` with new hooks and components
3. **Test**: Verify entry creation, analyst queries, goal detection, check-ins
4. **Customize**: Adjust prompts, UI styling, check-in schedules
5. **Monitor**: Watch for errors in edge function logs

## Support

- See `MVP_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md` for detailed integration steps
- Check README.md for project setup
- All services are documented with JSDoc comments
- All components use existing theme system

Your existing app continues to work unchanged. The MVP is **opt-in** via hook swapping.
