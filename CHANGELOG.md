# Major UI Improvements & Feature Updates

## Overview
This branch contains significant improvements to the Rifty app's user interface, authentication system, and core functionality. The changes focus on better user experience, cleaner code organization, and enhanced feature differentiation.

## üöÄ Major Features Added

### 1. **Separated Note & AI Chat System**

- **Benefits**: 
  - Users can now distinguish between personal notes and AI interactions
  - AI questions/responses no longer count towards note counter
  - Cleaner, more organized conversation history

### 2. **Enhanced Entry Management**
- **Delete Individual Notes**: Long-press on any note to delete it with confirmation
- **Delete All Entries**: Added "Delete All" button in footer for each entry type (Goals, Journals, Schedules)

- **Date Positioning**: Moved dates to left side for better readability

### 3. **Completely Redesigned Authentication System**

### 4. **Advanced Menu System**
- **Swipe Gesture**: Swipe right to open menu with smooth "gelly-like" animation
